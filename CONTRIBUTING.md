## I18n - Internationalization and localization

We want the tracker to be as easy to use as possible and have therefore added support for different languages, hopefully making it more easy to understand.

All languages are welcome and to contribute a new language just follow these steps:

1. Follow steps 1-4 above to get the tracker running locally.
2. Create a new `.json` file in `./src/i18n/locales/` with the desired locale.
3. Copy the contents of the `en-US.json` file in the same directory.
4. Translate all values to the desired language.
5. Add your new locale file in [./i18n/locales.js](https://github.com/iiKline/dm-nebula/blob/main/src/i18n/locales.js):
```javascript
import enUs from './locales/en-US.json'
import svSE from './locales/sv-SE.json'
// import [locale] from './locales/[locale].json'

export default {
	'en-US': enUs,
	'sv-SE': svSE,
  // '[locale]': [locale]
}
```
6. Follow steps 6-8 above to finalize your contribution.

We use the [flag-icons](https://flagicons.lipis.dev/) library by [lipis](https://github.com/lipis) for the flags, so make sure that your locale has a supported flag in the library.

## Camouflage images

If you want to help contribute some images for the camouflages, the process is the same as described above but with a few preferable additions:

* The images should be in 1x1 format (perfectly squared, or close enough).
* No borders or background behind the camouflage, just the camouflage itself.
* The naming of the files should follow the [slug-format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug) (`Desert Hybrid` -> `desert-hybrid`).
* The files should preferably be in `.png` file format.
* Place the files in the `./src/assets/camouflages` folder.

If you don't have access to any image editing software (besides Paint), [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) is an amazing and completely free Photoshop alternative. I will also happily accept any images, or in-game screenshots, of the camouflages on my email ([hello@emilcarlsson.se](hello@emilcarlsson.se)) and I can edit and add them to the site myself!

> **Note:** The camouflage images are hosted on an external server that I need to manually upload the images to, so it might take a while before they are added to the site. This also means that they can't be tested locally.
